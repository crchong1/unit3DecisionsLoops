Game Of Life- Reflection Document
By Connor Chong

Throughout this Game of Life, I was mainly blown away at the (ingenious) solution of having two grids. 
It was like almost a new way of thinking to solve different problems. Overall, I enjoyed the lab,
even though at first the documentation was pretty fustrating. I think it was a good idea to hand trace
the solution.
